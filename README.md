## wrappers

I find myself jumping between languages often, some more often than others. Common frustration I have is forgetting the most used commands to run X, or build Y, usually with a different syntax. Version management is worse, not realizing the project I’m in uses a version I don’t currently have set in global.

These wrappers help unify and solve most of the headaches I feel, taking care of version management, script execution, and running scoped binaries. Scripts are targeted to fit my environment (MacOS, zsh), but can easily be modified to fit whoevers needs. Docs can be found within each script.
